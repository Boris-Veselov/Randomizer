# Group project #1

# Random movie generator

AS a user who likes different movies
I WANT to be suggesed a movie
SO THAT it’s easier for me to pick a movie to watch


GIVEN I don’t know what to watch
WHEN I open the website
THEN I’m presented with an options tab to choose from available categories that help me choose a movie
WHEN I click the button to generate a movie, a movie suggestion pops up
WHEN I scroll down 
THEN the movie description is presented with a link to a trailer

Optional:
When I scroll down 
THEN I’m presented with a button to save a movie to watch later
WHEN I click the button
THEN the movie is saved to the favorite movie list


Optional:
When I scroll down, I’m presented with a button to generate a random snack idea to watch a movie
WHEN I click on a button
THEN I’m presented with a random snack idea
